Progressive Computing - PC Mon 2.0 for Superboard - Read Me
===========================================================

This was in my Superboard II in the fake wood case purchased via Kijiji (I think)
from a man in London. The Superboard was traded to Walter M in 2019 and the ROM
was dumped by Josh B.

This is ROM appears to be a variation of the SYN600 ROM but with a 30-character display.
It displays the "D/C/W/M" prompt.
